# Minesweeper-AI
Duration: April 2020

The idea for minesweeper came a little bit out of nowhere but it was mostly inspired by the youtuber Code Bullet in his video titled, "I created a PERFECT minesweeper AI". In his video, he created a AI that completes a game of minesweeper. He illustrates the algorithm behind the AI and I thought it was simple enough to replicate. As such I went on to code a minesweeper interface that allowed for different board sizes. Then I created an AI that could play the game by interacting with the interface. While coding it, I realized that the way code bullet described his implementation would make the AI run super slowly. Perhaps Code Bullet gave us an inaccurate abridged version of his AI but I did not find his algorithm practical. As such, I then went on and implemented my own algorithm in solving a minesweeper game. This algorithm is based on how I would play the game so I do not claim that it is the "Perfect AI" but it works ...some of the time. It can deterministically calculate the mines based on the numbers on the board and then uses a probabilistic method to find a spot with the least chance of containing a mine. It is my first experience working with AI and implementing its algorithm.
